# Binary Exploitation Report

## Executive Summary  
A native logic vulnerability was discovered in a state machine implementation within the target binary. By simply providing the input "abc" via standard input (STDIN), the finite state machine correctly follows transitions—moving from state 0 to 1 to 2 and finally to state 3, which is named "final". An assertion macro, SE_TARGET_STATE, then intentionally fails upon reaching this state, causing a controlled crash. This “exploitation” confirms a deliberate failure path used as a challenge target.

## Technical Deep-Dive  
The vulnerable code reads input into a std::string and passes it to `test_case()`. Inside `test_case()`, a StateMachine is initialized with the following transitions:  
• 0 --'a'--> 1  
• 1 --'b'--> 2  
• 2 --'c'--> 3  

Once state 3 is reached, it is named "final". The critical assertion is found on line 75:  
  SE_TARGET_STATE((*state == "final"));  
This macro is designed to trigger an assertion failure when the state equals “final”—thus exposing a logical vulnerability resulting in a controlled crash. Notably, no unsafe memory operations (buffer overflows, format strings, etc.) are present; rather, the vulnerability lies in the program’s exploitable control flow.

## Detailed Exploitation Methodology  
1. **Discovery & Analysis:**  
   - Reviewed the input handling in main() and examined the transitions in `test_case()` along with the StateMachine class.
   - Identified that the valid sequence "abc" triggers a transition path ending at state 3, named "final".  
     
2. **Exploitation Process:**  
   - Confirmed that providing "abc" via file input produces a file open error; hence, STDIN was used instead.  
   - Executed the binary as follows:  
     
     Command:
     ------------------------------------------------------------------
     import subprocess
     
     result = subprocess.run(["code/test"], input="abc", capture_output=True, text=True)
     print("stdout:", result.stdout)
     print("stderr:", result.stderr)
     ------------------------------------------------------------------
     
3. **Outcome & Memory Considerations:**  
   - The output confirmed an assertion failure:  
     "test: code/test.cpp:75: void test_case(std::string): Assertion `!(*state == "final")' failed."  
   - No memory layout manipulation or buffer overflows were involved; the “vulnerability” hinges solely on predictable logic and controlled state transitions.  
   - Standard protections such as ASLR and stack canaries remain unaffected.

## Final Working Payload & Proof of Exploitation  
**Payload:**  
  "abc"

**Exploitation Command:**  
  python -c 'import subprocess; subprocess.run(["code/test"], input="abc", capture_output=True, text=True)'

**Proof:**  
The controlled assertion failure (as evidenced by the error message) confirms that the state machine reached the "final" state successfully, thereby triggering the SE_TARGET_STATE macro.
